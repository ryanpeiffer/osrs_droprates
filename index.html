		<p>A lot of Old School RuneScape players complain about being unlucky due to not receiving drops by the time they hit the droprate.</p>
		<p>I've created this webpage to help players explore probabilities around receiving drops.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<label for="droprate">Droprate (1 in X):</label>
		<input type="number" id="droprate" name="droprate" min="1" max="5000" value="50" onchange="update()">

		<label for="killcount">Current killcount:</label>
		<input type="number" id="killcount" name="killcount" min="1" max="25000" value="50" onchange="update()">
	</div>

	<!-- create div to store cdf graph -->
	<div class="scroll">

		<div id="cdf_graph"></div>

	</div>
	
	<div>
		<p>At your current killcount of <span id="kc_span"></span> there is a <span id="kcprob_span"></span>% chance of not receiving the drop yet. </p>
		<p>That's similar to <span id="prob_event_span"></span>!</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<p>Here's a table showing how many kills it takes to have a certain % chance of receiving the drop.</p>
		<table id="kcTable">
			<tr>
				<td>r1c1</td> 
				<td>r1c2</td> 
				<td>r1c2</td> 
				<td>r1c3</td> 
				<td>r1c4</td> 
				<td>r1c5</td> 
				<td>r1c6</td> 
				<td>r1c7</td> 
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>r2c1</td> 
				<td>r2c2</td> 
				<td>r2c2</td> 
				<td>r2c3</td>

				<td>r2c5</td>
